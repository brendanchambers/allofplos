      "      The prevalence of punding in patients with PD was 5.4%. Punding behaviors were closely related to previous occupations or hobbies and showed a temporal relationship to changes of levodopa-equivalent dose (LED). Significant predisposing factors were a long duration of PD and intake of medications of PD, high total daily LED, dyskinesia, and impulse control disorder. Punding severity was correlated with LED (\n",

Currently, non-motor symptoms, including psychiatric and behavioral disorders have become the focus of active concern because these symptoms can lead to a greater level of incapacity than do motor complications.[\n",

Although the exact pathophysiology of punding has not yet been established, it is suggested that neural plastic changes in the dorsal and ventral striatal structures due to chronic intermittent stimulation by dopaminergic medications and impaired reward mechanisms may be involved in a possible pathomechanism for punding.[\n",

In the present study, we demonstrated that PD-punders performed poorly on cognitive tasks involving frontal executive functions and had regional cortical thinning in the dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal areas. These findings suggest that the DLPFC and OFC and its related frontal executive functions contribute to the development of punding behavior in patients with PD.\n",

      "    The reported prevalence of punding in PD patients was quite variable, in the range of 1.4–14%, depending on the questionnaires or interview tools used to screen for punding in each study. Additionally, it is quite difficult to detect punding without detailed interviews of patients and their relatives as physicians often seem to overlook the phenomenon and/or misdiagnose it. Patients can also neglect to mention the behavior or consider it rather fascinating and soothing. The present study used rigorous direct interviews conducted by neurological specialists and found that the prevalence was 5.4% in patients with PD, which is consistent with the figures reported by previous studies.[\n",

Similarly, our data indicated that long duration of PD and PD medication, high total daily LED, and presence of dyskinesia and ICD were significant risk factors for developing punding behavior.\n",

Together with neuroadaptation and impaired reward circuits, frontal lobe function and its relation with the ventral striatum through fronto-striatal circuits has been suggested to control and modulate the dopamine-dependent induction of the repetitive stereotypic behavior.[\n",

In the voxel-based analysis of cortical thickness, PD-punders showed significant cortical thinning in DLPFC relative to controls, whereas PD-nonpunders had cortical thickness comparable to controls.

In punding behavior, however, impairment of inhibitory control is important feature, but non-goal-directed action and aimless behavior is also a necessary condition to develop punding behavior. Although DLPFC and OFC are structurally and functionally distinctive areas each other, both areas are subdivisions of the prefrontal cortex. Many studies reported the contribution of the function of two cortices in neurological and psychological disorders.[\n",

      "    ] The dysfunction of DLPFC can play a role in the aimless and unplanned movements and destructed OFC can contribute to impaired inhibition of action. Thus, we can postulate that prefrontal cortex including the anterior and anterolateral parts of the middle frontal gyrus may modulate the development of punding. Right frontal operculum, pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, is another candidate for the neural substrate of punding. The role of frontal operculum in non-dominant side has not yet been revealed well. Few studies reported the motor and cognitive function of the frontal operculum that it plays an important role in the suppression of response tendencies, and it also is related to hand movements.[\n",

Accordingly, we suggest from the present study that the frontal cortex involving dorsolateral and orbitofrontal areas and its related cognitive domain may be a prime neuroanatomical and cognitive substrate of punding, indicating that the presence or degree of frontal dysfunction may be a predisposing factor for the development of punding behavior in patients with PD.\n",

      "    ] In the present study, PD-punders tended to have a higher levodopa LEDs than did PD-nonpunders, whereas dopamine agonist LEDs did not differ between groups. We think that punding seems to be related with the dosage of levodopa medication rather than dopamine agonists. However, a larger sample size of the PD-punder group is needed to assess the specific dopamine receptor(s) responsible for punding behavior in patients with PD.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Several limitations of our study need to be addressed. First, the number of cases of PD patients with punding was too small. Large numbers of cases are needed to draw firm conclusions about the exact cognitive profile and neuroanatomical substrate involved in punding. Nevertheless, we recruited punders via a direct interview with trained neurologists, and misdiagnosis or underestimation of punding seems unlikely. Second, we could not get a result of difference in direct comparison of cortical thickness between PD-punders and PD-nonpunders in the vertex-based analysis of whole cerebral cortex. Further studies with large cases are necessary to compare the frontal cortical atrophy directly between two groups. Third, the presence of ICD and dyskinesia in PD is frequently accompanied by punding behavior. The results of the present study may not exactly reflect the effects of punding alone. Fourth, PD-punders group completed neuropsychological tests and underwent brain MRI within 6 months before and after diagnosis of punding. Examinations scheduled at fixed intervals relative to the appearance of punding would be the best approach to making exact comparisons between two groups. Fifth, PD-punders did not show a significant difference in all cognitive items after correction for multiple comparisons, and there was a tendency of declined cognition in frontal executive function. Therefore, the results neurocognitive profiles should be interpreted cautiously.\n",

      "    In summary, we demonstrated that PD patients with punding had a tendency of cognitive deficits in the frontal executive functions, and showed more extensive cortical atrophy in the dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal areas. These data indicate that prefrontal modulation may be an essential component in the development of punding behavior in patients with PD.\n",

      "Background\n",
      "Punding, one of dopamine replacement treatment related complications, refers to aimless and stereotyped behaviors. To identify possible neural correlates of punding behavior in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), we investigated the patterns of cognitive profiles and cortical thinning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "Of the 186 subjects with PD screened during the study period, we prospectively enrolled 10 PD patients with punding and 43 without punding on the basis of a structured interview. We performed comprehensive neuropsychological tests and voxel-based and regions-of-interest (ROIs)-based cortical thickness analysis between PD patients with and without punding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Results\n",
      "The prevalence of punding in patients with PD was 5.4%. Punding behaviors were closely related to previous occupations or hobbies and showed a temporal relationship to changes of levodopa-equivalent dose (LED). Significant predisposing factors were a long duration of PD and intake of medications of PD, high total daily LED, dyskinesia, and impulse control disorder. Punding severity was correlated with LED (p = 0.029). The neurocognitive assessment revealed that PD patients with punding showed more severe cognitive deficits in the color Stroop task than did those without punding (p = 0.022). Voxel-based analysis showed that PD-punders had significant cortical thinning in the dorsolateral prefrontal area relative to controls. Additionally, ROI-based analysis revealed that cortical thinning in PD-punders relative to PD-nonpunders was localized in the prefrontal cortices, extending into orbitofrontal area.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusions\n",
      "We demonstrated that PD patients with punding performed poorly on cognitive tasks in frontal executive functions and showed severe cortical thinning in the dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal areas. These findings suggest that prefrontal modulation may be an essential component in the development of punding behavior in patients with PD.\n",
